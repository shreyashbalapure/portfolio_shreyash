              I am a Software Developer with a strong passion for building
              innovative full-stack applications that solve real-world
              challenges. Specializing in MERN stack development, I excel at
              creating scalable, high-performance web solutions with seamless
              user experiences and robust backend architectures.
            </p>
            <p>
              Holding a Bachelor’s degree in Computer
              Applications (BCA), I have honed my expertise in React.js,
              Node.js, and competitive Java coding. My problem-solving skills,
              backed by algorithmic thinking, enable me to develop efficient,
              optimized solutions for complex technical challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond development, I am an active contributor to open-source
              projects and stay ahead of industry trends through continuous
              learning and innovation. I thrive in collaborative environments,
              where I can share knowledge, mentor others, and drive impactful
              digital transformations.
